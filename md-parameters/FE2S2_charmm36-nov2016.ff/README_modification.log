	 S10		 SG        {{ NO:: defined in QM - FES molecule }}

Therefore, for defining a molecule CSG {CYS3 without SG, a atom type is defined for C10 and the bonded/angle/dihedral terms for C10 has to be defined {only for CSG} from Dr Da Silva ff.
	* a CSG molecule is defined in merged.rtp {{ charges same as CYS3 (Dr da Silva) }} 
	* a C10 atom type in ffnonbonded.itp {{ param different than CT2 }}
	* two bond types of C10 {{ same eq val, diff ks }}
	* five angle types of C1O  
	* seven dihedral types of C1O


A FES {FE2S6} molecule type is defined in merged.rtp: 
	* three atom types defined in ffnonbonded.itp {{ SSG = SM ; FF = FE (or da silva) ; SF = SS (or da silva) }}  
	* two bond types are defined {{ average of all bond values in QM }}  {{ 5 digit force constants (10x lower) (same da silva) }}
	* four angle types are defined  {{ angle(FF-SF-FF) = angle(SF-FF-SF) and total of 360 degress, plus U-B terms based on FF-FF bond }}
	* three dihedral {{ Toshiko Ichiye value of 0.80 }} {{ No dihedral for SSG - FES i.e., Kchi = 0.00 ; mult = 2 }}


A bond between FES and CSG is defined for bonds,angles and dihedrals ::
	* a bond is defined.
	* three angle types are defined {{ for SSG-C1O-HA2 = 109 not considereing one outlier i.e. 54 }} {{ values are lower than Charmm36 ~317 }}
                                        {{ for SSG-C1O-CT1 ~ 70 lower than CHARMM36 ~112 }} {{ Kphi also lower }}
	* 7 dihedral types are defined  


Four atom types are defined in atomtypes.atp
	* C1O {{ dr da Silva }}
	* SSG  {{ same as sulfur or iron }}
	* SF
	* FF


==============================================	IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE =============================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A major difference between CSG as comp to CYS2 and CYS3  {{ others being smaller value of Ks }}.
	  angle			   CSG				  CYS2				 CYS3
	* SSG-C1O-CT1		70.6425 295.568			112.5 485.34			118 460
		*** If measured for all cystines in 4jx1 (total 40) the angles is ~113.982
										Hence, modified for 113.982


A major missing angle type is
	* FF-SF-FF {{ additional bond found FF-FF }} 
			the value taken to be 76 (total 360 deg for FES) and Kphi == Kphi for SF-FF-SF angle and 
			FF-FF bond as Urey-Bradley potential.


The dihedrals:
	* the dihedrals within CSG are taken from CYS3 {{ Dr da Silva }}.
	* additional dihedrals within CSG and FES are based on toshiko Ichiye value of 0.80
	* dihedrals between CSG and FES are 0.
	* multiplicity is defined on the basis of possible rotameric states.

Additional changes in sc2.8:::::   {{ final scaling factor :: 2.8 }}

	* all Ks rescaled  {{ Only for those taken from QM calculations and not for those taken from Dr. da Silva }}
		i.e.,
			three bond ks {{ FF-SF ; FF-SSG ; SSG-C1O }}
			seven angle ks {{ SF-FF-SF ; SF-FF-SSG ; SSG-FF-SSG ; FF-SF-FF ; 
					  SSG-C1O-HA2 ; SSG-C1O-CT1 ; FF-SSG-C1O }}
			two dihedral {{ internal to FES ring }} to HIS Imidazole ring value of 58.57
		{{ the scaling factor did not change the equilibrium values::: }}
	* FES dihedral values equal to HIS imidazole ring i.e., 58.57  {{ Tried but did not work, worked for 0.8 if dihedral is 180 }}
	* angle type FF-SSG-C1O - changed to 102.53 {{ mistake from lsat one }}
