## I-helix is the allosteric carrier in cytochrome P450cam

We deciphered the allosteric functioning mechanism of cytochrome P450cam, which are ubiquitous heme-metalloenzymes involved in multitude of metabolic and industrial reactions as monooxygenases. Despite widely studied, their conformational heterogeneity, its substrate dependence and multi-substrate allostericity could not be understood. We explain that the I helix has intrinsic ability to exist in straight to kinked conformational extremes owing to its constituent G248 and G249 residues. These I helix conformations drive the known conformational changes in channel-1, channel-2 and allosteric coupling between active and allosteric sites, hence serving as the underlying determinant. The I-helix based allosteric mechanism reconcile the 125 crystallographic snaphots with evident straight to kinked conformations of I helix. The substrate-free and substrate-bound NMR PCS measurements can be matched with kinked and straight conformations with Q-scores of 0.108 and 0.061 respectively. The kink generating glycine G249 is remarkably conserved with proability of 0.912, with further signatures of even upto humans. The I-helix based allosteic mechanism also allows for the design of constitutively closed and open P450cam constructs for the first time. Together, our findings provide a departure from traditional FG-helix centric view of cytochrome P450 to a novel I-helix centric view. \
